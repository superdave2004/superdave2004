I had a dmca notice, cant figure out how to clean history out. bfg is too confusing and have no clue how to use it even after reading instructions. i tried to comply best i could by deleting infringing content and deleting files, but still lost my repos. if someone can direct me to a noobi friendly instructions that would help am a bit overwelmed at how much to learn.
